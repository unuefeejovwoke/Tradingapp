# Tradingapp
Our startup has given 10 stock traders $100 each to trade. The Dynamic User and Admin Dashboard App is designed to allow each trader to track their profit or loss over time, with data points recorded at 1-minute intervals. Additionally, an admin dashboard provides a way for managers to track the performance of the 10 traders.
